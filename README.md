#### About comment system
The comment system are all need to configure some external stuffs. The [`vssue`](https://vssue.js.org/), [`gitalk`](https://gitalk.github.io/) requires you to [create a OAuth Application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) for comment, and go to `_config.yml` to input some information. But the [`utterances`](https://utteranc.es/) just only needs needs to [install a application](https://github.com/apps/utterances/) and then use it.  
The [`disqus`](https://disqus.com/) is the most famous comment system in blog. It is also good. But [`disqus`](https://disqus.com/) will be unusable in some country ...  
[`Valine`](https://valine.js.org) is so free in account username and it support emoji. But it needs to [create a application in LeanCloud](https://leancloud.cn/dashboard/applist.html#/newapp).
